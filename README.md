## Background 
### The Challenge: 
From the Columbia Business School Tamer Center: 
“How can we leverage AI to increase teaching of business and climate change at peer business schools across the US and  reduce the barriers for faculty to share their open access syllabi, course materials, and cases?” 

### Problem Statement: 
Business schools do not have a centralized platform for sharing climate course materials. 
Business school courses do not integrate climate change solutions into the core curriculum.  
Business school students do not have the opportunity to practice climate change concepts or implement frameworks in a practical way. 
There is a disparity between industry needs of practitioners (e.g. CSOs) and what’s being taught in business schools today. MBAs don’t graduate with a “climate toolkit”. 
Business school professors, while they may be very knowledgeable in their discipline, are not necessarily climate leaders nor do they stay abreast of climate change solutions and topics to integrate into their courses. Professors working on climate change may be siloed or in a different department – information isn’t shared well across universities. 

### The Solution:

ClimateRepo is an open sharing platform for business school professors and students designed to make it easier to integrate climate concepts into the MBA experience. 

OUR GOAL  is to equip 150,000 MBA students annually with the skills they need to implement climate change in their post-MBA careers.
